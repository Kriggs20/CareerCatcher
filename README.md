# Career Catcher
This program runs a job finding web application. When starting the program you can see a homepage with information about the team and detaiuls about the project.
Also, you will be able to naviagate to a login page where you as a user will be saved and you can log back in at a different time in the future. 
While searching for jobs you can set what your search preferences are and then start typing what you are looking for. For testing purposes I have added many jobs manually and when
you start to search for them job cards will dynamically start appearing based on what the user has started typing. Finally, if you see a job you particularly enjoy you
will be able to save it and easily access/view it at a later time.
